  "description": "It all began with the forging of the Great Cryptos. Three were given to the Elves; immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings. Seven, to the Dwarf Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And many, SO MANY cryptocurrencies were gifted to the race of Humans, who above all else desired riches. For within these cryptos was bound the strength and the will to make tons of money. But they were all of them deceived, for another cryptocurrency was made. In the land of the USA, on the computer in my house, the Great Wizard Viraj forged in secret, a master crypto, to control all others. And into the creation of this Solana token he poured all his tech skills, his brain power, and his will to dominate all other items stored on a blockchain. One crypto to rule them all.",
